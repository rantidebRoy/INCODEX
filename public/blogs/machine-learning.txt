Machine learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, has become a game-changer in various industries. It involves training algorithms to learn from data, enabling systems to make predictions and decisions without being explicitly programmed.

Applications of Machine Learning:
- Predictive Analytics: Forecasting future trends.
- Natural Language Processing: Understanding human language.
- Image Recognition: Identifying objects in images.
- Personalized Recommendations: Suggesting products based on behavior.

As data becomes the new oil, machine learning is the engine that extracts value from it, transforming how businesses operate and serve their customers.
